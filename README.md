# Linux-Gaming-Guide
This repo is meant to be a guide for new Linux gamers from beginner to advanced.

The very first and convenient way to play games on Linux is to simply use Flatpak instead of native installs. I have read many online users spreading misleading info that Flatpak has issues, this may have been correct a long time ago, but now, it’s absolutely not true, I have been gaming on Linux for a long time (over 250 games); Mostly all run without any issues.

Step 1; Choose a Linux distro.
Every Linux distro has advantages and dis-advantages, have better communities and documentation. Choose which one works for, HOWEVER, because we are using Flatpak, there is a convenience factor, if it works in one Linux distro, 99.99% it will work in any other Linux distro on Flatpak.

Don’t fall in the trap of “This Linux distro is better than one” trap, and you should know the difference between a Linux distro and a Desktop Environment -DE-.

If you are a beginner, don’t be afraid, this is a lot easier that you imagine, especially if you know to search for information, just like any other Operating System -OS-. For example, if you don’t know how play videos on your PC or laptop, you would search for “How to play video”. Its that simple.

If you would like to save time, here is list of recommendation, you can’t go wrong with any, and there is a lot of convenience factors that I have taken into consideration.

If you are a completely new to Linux:

If you are a beginner: the most convenient way is to use Fedora Workstation

the official Fedora uses Gnome DE, if you click on spins, you can also use Fedora KDE DE.

If however you want some challenge and want to learn more, there are people like that, I personally recommend Fedora Silver. You can use Fedora Media Writer to get it under Emerging Editions.
You will learn about Containers and Toolboxes and so much more.

Regardless of your choice, have fun.

Once you choose you Linux distro you can use any tool you want to write it to a USB, for convience sake, you can use Fedora Media Writer to write any Linux ISO to a USB, including Ubuntu etc…
here is your first taste of documentation, don’t get scared now : https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-and-using-a-live-installation-image/

If however you like to try a Linux distro to see if you like it or not, the most convenient way is to use Ventoy: https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html
